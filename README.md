# Awesome "Network Science Meets AI" (NetSAI)
A collection of papers, books, teaching materials and iniatitives on the interesection between AI and Network Science.

## Events and Initiatives
- Submissions for our Special Issue ["Bridging Network Science and AI"](https://link.springer.com/collections/hafcebgfci) on Applied Network Science by Springer are open! Submit your work by the end of June 2025.
- We will host a [special session](https://sites.google.com/view/esann-netsai/home) titled “Network Science meets AI” at the next ESANN conference in April 2025.

## About NetSAI
