# Awesome "Network Science Meets AI" (NetSAI)
A collection of papers, books, teaching materials, and initiatives on the intersection between AI and Network Science.

## Events and Initiatives
- Submissions for a Special Issue ["Bridging Network Science and AI"](https://link.springer.com/collections/hafcebgfci) on Applied Network Science by Springer are open! Submit your work by the end of June 2025.
- The Network Science meets AI tour stops in this year's edition of [HONS](https://hons-web.github.io/online/), titled "High-order Network Science meets AI" (HONAI)
- A [special session](https://sites.google.com/view/esann-netsai/home) titled “Network Science meets AI” will be hosted at the next ESANN conference in April 2025.

## Papers
### Survey, tutorial, and position papers
- [ArXiv] **Insights from Network Science can advance Deep Graph Learning** [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01177)

## About NetSAI 
The repository contains slides presenting the initiative. These slides were part of an oral talk for the ["Learning on Graph"](https://sites.google.com/student.unisi.it/log24siena/home-page) meetup in Siena, 2024.

## Network Science Conferences
NetSci, NetSciX, Conference on Complex Systems (CCS), CompleNet, Complex Networks and their Applications (CNA).
